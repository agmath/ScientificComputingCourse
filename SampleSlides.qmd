## Purpose

This slide deck shows implements the following items

1. How to create numbered and bulleted lists (like this numbered list)
2. How to force incremental reveals by using the triple dot (`. . . `)
3. Creating hyperlinks
4. Embedding images from a web URL and also embedding an image stored as a local file
5. Using Python functonality to summarize data and produce visuals

. . . 

Inspecting the source code (the `SampleSlides.qmd` file) shows how to achieve each of the goals above

## Creating Numbered and Bulleted Lists (Bullets)

You saw how to create a numbered list on the previous slide. Below is a simple bulleted list.

+ Item 1
+ Item 2
+ Item 3

In the source code, notice the triple dots (`. . . `) below which prevents the line below from being revealed until you progress the slide forward.

. . .

You can also nest items in your list by using whitespace and indentation. The empty line in the source code below is important -- removing it will remove the nested list structure.

+ Item 1

    + Sub-item 1.1
    + Sub-item 1.2
+ Item 2
+ Item 3

    + Sub-item 3.1

## Creating Hyperlinks

If you want more details about how to create *Revealjs* slides in Quarto, here is [a link to the documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)

## Embedding Images (URL)

Below is an image from a URL on the web

![Three images of elephants, showing how diverse the species is.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Elephant_Diversity.jpg/1920px-Elephant_Diversity.jpg)

## Embedding Images (Local File)

Below is an image from a file stored locally. 

![Three images of elephants, showing how diverse the species is.](Elephant_Diversity.jpg)

Note that the path to the file is relative to the location of this `qmd` source file. Since the image is stored in the same directory as the `qmd` source, we just need the name of the file.

## Python Functionality for Summarizing Data

One of the best advantages of Quarto is that it permits all aspects of an analysis, including data processing to be housed in a single file. This means complete transparency into the analysis done. Whereas alternative workflows, like doing an analysis in Excel and then pasting tables and charts into a document-writing software like Word or presentation software like Powerpoint, force the consumer to put blind trust in the analyst because the workflow is completely inaccessible.

. . . 

Below is code that reads in a data set and produces a set of summary statistics.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

austin = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agmath/agmath.github.io/master/data/classification/austin_zillow_data.csv")

austin.groupby("city").agg({
    "lotSizeSqFt" : [np.mean, np.median, np.std]
}).reset_index()
```

## Python Functionality for Data Visualization

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.kdeplot(data = austin, x = "lotSizeSqFt", hue = "priceRange", fill = True, alpha = 0.5)
plt.xscale("log")
plt.show()
```
